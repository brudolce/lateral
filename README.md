## Tests
For testing I am using jest + Enzyme. Enzyme is powerful and was very used from 2015-2018, initially by airBnb devs, but outdated nowadays. Mainly for complex query methods, and anti-pattern possibilities, like white box tests (test very intricate and not necessary component methods, styles and behaviours).

Currently, what is more common from god(stackoverflow) words and discussions, is having an easier and more flexible testing setup in the front, like jest + react-testing-library for unitary tests, and Cypher or Selenium for e2e tests,

## Styles
I am using 100% inline styles. I do not know why. I was on the mood for it. It is harder to test and debug components, not the best practice, but gives you a java UI feeling.
